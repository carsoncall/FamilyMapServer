### FamilyMapServer

This is a simple, but effective backend for the FamilyMap application. I built this app as part of my Computer Science coursework. It uses a very object-oriented approach to handle tasks, using separate classes for requests, responses, services, database operations, and more. It uses SQLite for the database, and is annotated to work with JavaDoc.
